Pulse is not only a great live concert film, but also a historical document of Pink Floyd's final tour with David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright. The tour was one of the most successful and expensive in rock history, with over 5 million people attending 120 shows in 68 cities across Europe and North America. The tour also featured a massive stage design that included a 40-foot circular screen, a 35-foot mirror ball, a 24-foot inflatable pig and a replica of the Battersea Power Station.[^1^]
 
The film was directed by David Mallet, who had previously worked with Pink Floyd on their music videos and concert films. Mallet used over 20 cameras to capture the band's performance from different angles and perspectives. He also incorporated the screen films that were projected on the circular screen during the show, which added another layer of visual interest and symbolism. The film was edited by Dave Gardener, who had to synchronize the footage from different nights and locations.[^2^]
 
Pulse was originally released on VHS and Laserdisc in June 1995, with a DVD release coming in July 2006. The DVD release contained numerous bonus features, such as additional songs, alternate screen films, music videos, behind-the-scenes footage and more. In 2019, a newly restored and re-edited version was released on Blu-ray and DVD as part of The Later Years box-set; this version was given a standalone release on 18 February 2022.[^3^] The Blu-ray version is the first release of Pulse in HD, although it is upconverted from the original SD video recording and remains in its 4:3 aspect ratio.[^2^]
